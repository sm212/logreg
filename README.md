Just a place to put notes as i work through the [logistic regression book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logistic-Regression-Self-Learning-Statistics-Biology/dp/1441917411/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=logistic+regression+a+self&qid=1615129880&s=books&sr=1-1).

I'm going to be dipping in & out of certain chapters rather than running though the book from start to finish so these could be a bit patchy - use at your own risk!
